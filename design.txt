STORY AND WORLD DESIGN ASPECTS
----------------------------------
Goal changes the more you know about the world.
At first, it's to head out to the kingdom of your realm and take it over and use its power to help the people. (?)
As you go through this playthrough, you discover more and more about the world and the power the king possesses.

The eastern realm belongs to a slumbering flaming dragon. Its fury and magic have steeped into the land.
The tribes and the people have come to know and respect the dragon's power, and they have begun to harness this power for their own.
Their relics and art represent shimmering, sharp edges and the dark steel cast in the flames of the dragon's power.
All of the people long for the day the dragon wakes, to lead them to conquer the earth.

To the west is a slumbering dragon of frost. Just as in the east, the dragon became a central part of the life of the tribes.
Unlike the flaming dragon, this dragon is awake, and shares its power and knowledge with the tribes.
This allowed them to become powerful sorcerers and soldiers alike, allowing their domain to remain mighty.
Visitors are not often welcome, as the realm is constantly besieged by attacks from the east.

OTHER FUN FEATURES WE DEFINITELY WANT
-----------------------------------------
-occasionally, defeating a notable enemy will give you the opportunity to travel with the person for some time.
-death causes all of your items to leave you. bummer.
defeating one of the Four Great Ones will allow you to deposit an item to be picked up in [Starting Zone] upon your death, allowing you to start with gear cards from your last run.
while there will be a storage chest at the spawn zone, that can be a long way from home.
there will be a few "hidden places" where you can stash item cards. not as hard to get to and can be used in a pinch, but not a promise that it will remain there...
-gear card or post-fight ability: TIME WARP, allows the player to go back ? years in time. when the player gets this, they should be able to open all four gates within the century.
be careful when using this item/spell: encountering yourself forces a battle against your party at the time...
